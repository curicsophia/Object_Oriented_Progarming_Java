Inheritance is a mechanism where  the child class inherits fields and methods from the parent class.
The child instance can be used in places where the parent instance is required.

Encapsulation is a mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates in a single unit.
If the data fields are made private you cannot access them and only the class methods can modify them.
This protects the data form incorrect useage.

Compile time polymorphism which is also known as static polymorphism.
This type of polymorphism is achieved by method overloading or operator overloading.
For example a method behaves differently when called with different type parameters.

Runtime polymorphism which is also known as Dynamic Method Dispatch. 
It is a process in which a function call to the overridden method is resolved at Runtime. 
For example using a child instance instead of a parent instance will result in calling the child's method instead of calling the
parent's method.
